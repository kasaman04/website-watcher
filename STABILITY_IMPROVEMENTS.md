# Website Watcher Stability Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the major stability improvements made to the Website Watcher application to address server accessibility issues and prevent crashes.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Blocking I/O in Async Context** ✅
**Problem**: `requests.get()` blocking calls in async functions were freezing the event loop
**Solution**: 
- Replaced `requests` with `httpx.AsyncClient`
- Implemented proper async HTTP handling with connection pooling
- Added `asyncio.to_thread()` for SMTP operations

### 2. **Infinite Loop with Poor Error Recovery** ✅
**Problem**: Basic while loop with minimal error handling could cause endless crashes
**Solution**:
- Exponential backoff retry logic (2^attempt, max 300s)
- Circuit breaker pattern (max 10 consecutive errors → 10min cooldown)
- Graceful task cancellation handling

### 3. **Resource Management Issues** ✅
**Problem**: Memory leaks, no log rotation, file handle accumulation
**Solution**:
- Log rotation (10MB max, 5 backup files)
- HTTP connection pooling (max 100 connections, 20 keepalive)
- Atomic file operations with backup support
- Proper resource cleanup on shutdown

### 4. **SMTP Connection Problems** ✅
**Problem**: Synchronous SMTP calls blocking the event loop
**Solution**:
- Async email service with circuit breaker
- 5 consecutive failures → 5min timeout
- Exponential backoff for email retries
- Configuration validation on startup

### 5. **API Overload from Frontend** ✅
**Problem**: Frontend polling every 30s from all clients causing server stress
**Solution**:
- Rate limiting: `/api/sites` (10/min), `/api/sites` POST (5/min), manual check (2/min)
- API response caching (30s TTL)
- Intelligent frontend polling (exponential backoff on errors)
- Page visibility detection for smart updates

### 6. **Task Management Issues** ✅
**Problem**: No monitoring of background tasks, no restart mechanism
**Solution**:
- Task monitor that checks monitoring task health every 5 minutes
- Automatic task restart on failure
- Proper task cancellation with timeouts
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 7. **Network and Timeout Issues** ✅
**Problem**: Fixed timeouts regardless of site characteristics
**Solution**:
- Dynamic timeout adjustment per site (based on response time)
- Site-level circuit breakers (3 failures → 10min cooldown)
- Better User-Agent and headers for compatibility
- Follow redirects properly

## New Features Added

### Health Check Endpoints
- `/api/health` - Application health status
- `/api/metrics` - Operational metrics for monitoring

### Monitoring Capabilities
- Circuit breaker status tracking
- Site failure count monitoring
- Email service health tracking
- Memory usage monitoring

### Configuration Improvements
- Environment variable validation
- Backup configuration file support
- Atomic configuration updates
- Better error messages

## Performance Improvements

### Parallel Processing
- Site checks now run in parallel (max 5 concurrent)
- Semaphore-based concurrency control
- Faster overall check completion

### Caching
- API response caching reduces database load
- Cache invalidation on data changes
- Smart cache keys and TTL

### Resource Optimization
- Connection reuse via HTTP client pooling
- Reduced memory footprint
- Better timeout management

## Error Handling

### Circuit Breakers
- **Email Service**: 5 failures → 5min timeout
- **Site Checking**: 3 failures per site → 10min timeout
- Automatic reset after timeout periods

### Exponential Backoff
- Email retries: 1s, 2s, 4s (max 60s)
- Monitoring loop: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s... (max 300s)
- API errors: Progressive delays

### Graceful Degradation
- Continue monitoring even if email service fails
- Skip problematic sites temporarily
- Maintain service for working components

## File Changes

### Major Updates
- `app.py`: Complete rewrite with async patterns and error handling
- `requirements.txt`: Added httpx, slowapi for rate limiting
- `static/index.html`: Intelligent polling with error handling

### New Files
- `config.json.backup`: Automatic configuration backup
- `STABILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`: This documentation

## Environment Variables

### Required
- `SMTP_USERNAME`: Email service username
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: Email service password  
- `FROM_EMAIL`: Sender email address

### Optional
- `CHECK_INTERVAL`: Site check interval in seconds (default: 300)
- `SITE_TIMEOUT`: HTTP timeout per site (default: 15)
- `MAX_SITES_PER_INSTANCE`: Maximum sites per instance (default: 50)
- `SMTP_SERVER`: SMTP server (default: smtp.gmail.com)
- `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP port (default: 587)

## Deployment Notes

### Installation
1. Install new dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Ensure environment variables are set
3. Restart the application

### Monitoring
- Check `/api/health` for application status
- Monitor `/api/metrics` for operational data
- Watch logs for circuit breaker status

### Troubleshooting
- Check health endpoint if server becomes unresponsive
- Review circuit breaker status in logs
- Verify email configuration if notifications fail

## Result

The application should now be significantly more stable with:
- ✅ No more blocking operations freezing the server
- ✅ Automatic recovery from errors and failures
- ✅ Resource management preventing memory leaks
- ✅ Rate limiting preventing API overload
- ✅ Monitoring and health check capabilities
- ✅ Graceful degradation under load

These improvements address all the major stability issues that could cause the server to become inaccessible on port 8888.
